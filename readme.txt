# Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a beginner-level Python program that demonstrates the use of **while loops** and **conditional statements**. The program repeatedly asks the user to guess a secret number until they guess correctly.

## How it works
- The secret number is set to `7`.  
- The program uses a **while loop** to keep asking the user for a guess.  
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:  
  - If the guess is correct → `"You Guess Right"`  
  - If the guess is higher than the secret number → `"Too High Guess"`  
  - If the guess is lower than the secret number → `"Too Low"`  
- The loop stops once the user guesses the correct number.

## Features
- Interactive number guessing game.  
- Provides dynamic hints to guide the user.  
- Perfect practice for **loops** and **conditionals** in Python.  

## How to use
1. Save the code as `number_guess.py`.  
2. Run the program in a Python environment (online compiler or local Python).  
3. Keep entering numbers until you guess the secret number.

## Example Output
Enter The Secret Number: 3
Too Low
Enter The Secret Number: 9
Too High
Enter The Secret Number: 7
You Guess Right
