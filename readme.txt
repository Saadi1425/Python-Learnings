# Password Checker (Python)

This is a beginner-level Python program that demonstrates the use of **while loops** and basic **input/output**. The program repeatedly asks the user to enter a password until the correct one is entered.

## How it works
- The correct password is set to `1234`.  
- The program uses a **while loop** to keep asking the user for input.  
- It counts the number of attempts the user makes.  
- Feedback is given after each attempt:  
  - If the guess is correct → `"Correct Password"`  
  - If the guess is wrong → `"Wrong Try Again"`  
- The loop stops once the user enters the correct password.

## Features
- Keeps track of the number of password attempts.  
- Provides clear feedback after each guess.  
- Easy to modify for different passwords.  

## How to use
1. Save the code as `password_checker.py`.  
2. Run the program in a Python environment (online compiler or local Python).  
3. Enter guesses until you find the correct password.  

## Example Output
Enter The Password: 1111
Wrong Try Again
You Have Tried password 1 Times
Enter The Password: 2222
Wrong Try Again
You Have Tried password 2 Times
Enter The Password: 1234
Correct Password
You've tried password 3 Time
